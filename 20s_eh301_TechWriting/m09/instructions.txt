Questions For Proposal Analysis:

 > Is the proposal specific about what it will do (the services it will offer,
   the research it will perform, etc)? What details are most important?
   Are any important pieces of information missing?

 > How strong or weak is the proposal in showing that it understands the
   needs of the funders?

 > How well does the proposal convince funders that the proposers are capable
   of successfully completing the proposed work? How does the proposal
   establish credibility?
