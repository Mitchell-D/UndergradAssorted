The usability test report asks you to provide a summary of your usability test in a 300-500-word memo (see Markel and Selber 253-255 for review of memo structure). In your memo, please provide the following information in these sections (labeled with the exact headers shown in bold below):

 <1> Introduction: A very brief introduction to your usability test that summarizes and a statement of the
     conclusions you drew from the test.
 <2> Methodology: A description of the test methodology, including the participant(s), test materials, and
     test procedure. Include the specific tasks that the user had to complete and any data that you collected (do
     not include the results of the data collection here, just say that you collected the data). A successful methodology
     section is specific enough that someone else reading it could conduct the same test in the same way that
     you did. Also, make sure not to include the user's actual name.
 <3> Findings: A summary of the findings, including any data that you collected (such as number of user errors
     how long it took to complete each task, any comments or survey results from the user, etc). Feel free
     to add visuals, such as graphs, if they help convey the data from the test.
 <4> Recommendations: Recommendations for revising your user help project based on the findings of the test
     Make sure that recommendations are specific, actionable, and supported by the data you found in the test
     Describe the recommendations so that someone else could implement the recommendations.

Your usability test report should be clear, concise, and informative.
