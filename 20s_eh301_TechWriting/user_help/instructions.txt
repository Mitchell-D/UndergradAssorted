For Project Two in EH 301: Technical Writing, students will create software user help in two
formats: a print-based user manual and a video tutorial. Projects can cover any software,
website (Canvas, Word, Ebay, Pinterest, etc), or video game. Students should choose a software
program they know well or one they want to learn.

Print-Based User Manual Requirements
------------------------------------

Students will create a short manual which can serve as either a quick start manual or a manual
that covers a specific function or functions of a software (for example, running macros in Word,
using formulas in Excel, setting up a Pinterest account, etc).

The manual should include at least the following items:
 > An explanation of the basics of the software program or website/specific function
 > An introduction to the manual
 > 5-10 tasks (such as "crop images" or "change account settings").
    >> very short introduction
    >> steps for completing the tasks
    >> how the program should respond
 > Screenshots that accompany tasks when appropriate

Print-based help should be user-centered, task-based, clear, concise, consistent, informative,
context-aware, and attractive. For more information about writing effective user help manuals,
consult the textbook and this link on task-oriented tech writing (LINK).

You may create a PDF manual for this requirement, or you may publish your user help as a website.
If you create a website, you will probably want to put each task on its own page, much like the
Facebook Help site (LINK).

Video Tutorial Requirements
---------------------------

Students will also create a video tutorial using Screencast-o-matic (LINK), Jing (LINK),
BandiCam (LINK), or another tutorial builder (LINK) (another list here (LINK)). Video tutorials
should include animated screen capture (that allows users to view you completing actions on the
screen) and narration. Each video should include at least the following content:

 > A brief introduction to the tutorial that previews the tasks and explains why users might
   find them helpful (and/or explains when users might actually use these tasks)
 > Step-by-step instructions guiding users through 2-4 specific tasks

Video tutorials should be user-centered, task-based, clear, concise, consistent, informative,
context-aware, and attractive. Multimedia tutorials can include some of the same text as the
print manual.

The User Help Project is due by 11:59 on Friday, March 13. You must submit both a print manual
AND a video tutorial for a chance at full credit on the project. Print manuals should be submitted
as a pdf file (or a link). Video tutorials can be submitted as a URL or file.
