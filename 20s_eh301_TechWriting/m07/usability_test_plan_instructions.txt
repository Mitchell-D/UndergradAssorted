 > Assignment is intended as preparation for Module 8 usability test
    >> Module 8 usability test is part of Project 2 (User Help Project)
 > Tests video tutorial or user help manual
 > List 2 to 4 objectives you intend to accomplish through investigation
   via the user test
 > User section is a demographic profile fo the user
    >> inform the user that you are teseting the document, not them...
       you can't do anything wrong as long as you follow directions
 > Methods section: look into different methods of testing such as...
    >> asking the user to think aloud through things
    >> give user 2 versions of the same document and ask them to compare
    >> ask user to mark anything that isn't immediately clear or is confusing
    >> ask user to complete tasks from start to finish.
       Note the fluidity of the process
 > Discuss methods in detail that would allow someone
   uninvolved to repeat the experiment
 > Neccesary Equipment section just lists things needed to complete the test fully
 > Data can be metrics in terms of time, number of errors, number of
   reverting to previous steps, and subjective user satisfaction.

Test plan:
 > Have user open file in context manager as iterator object
 > Use iterator to read numbers in, keeping the order they appear in the file
 > Have user use a list comprehension to remove
